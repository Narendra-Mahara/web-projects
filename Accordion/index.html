        <h1>2.What is JavaScript, and how is it used?</h1>
        <ion-icon name="chevron-down-outline"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily
        used to make web pages interactive. It can manipulate HTML and CSS,
        handle events, create dynamic content, and more. JavaScript is executed
        on the client side in a browser, but with environments like Node.js, it
        can also run on the server side.

          3.What is the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript?
        </h1>
        <ion-icon name="chevron-down-outline"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        var: Declares a variable with function scope or globally if declared
        outside a function. It can be redeclared and updated. let: Declares a
        block-scoped variable. It can be updated but not redeclared in the same
        scope. const: Declares a block-scoped constant. It must be initialized
        when declared and cannot be updated or redeclared.

        <h1>4.What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</h1>
        <ion-icon name="chevron-down-outline"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        ==: Performs type coercion and compares two values for equality after
        converting them to a common type. ===: Strict equality operator that
        compares both value and type. No type conversion is performed.

        <h1>5.What are closures in JavaScript?</h1>
        <ion-icon name="chevron-down-outline"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of
        the outer function, and the global scope. Closures allow functions to
        access variables from an outer function even after the outer function
        has returned. This is useful for data encapsulation and maintaining
        state across function calls.

      <div class="question">
        <h1>6.What is the event loop in JavaScript?</h1>
        <ion-icon name="chevron-down-outline"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows asynchronous
        operations (like setTimeout, Promises, and I/O tasks) to be handled
        without blocking the main thread. JavaScript is single-threaded, so the
        event loop manages the execution of multiple asynchronous operations by
        pushing callback functions onto a message queue, which the loop
        processes once the call stack is empty.
